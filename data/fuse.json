Over the course of her lifetime, she was married eight times to seven different husbands. Eighth time the charm, she secretly married the love of her life `Celia St James`, also an Oscar-winning actress. In an era prior to the acceptance of bisexuality, she was a bisexual. As she says herself, `I spent half my time loving her and half hiding how much I loved her.`. Evelyn, like any other human, made mistakes along the way. Although some of them were unforgivable, she believed she did what had to be done for her survival. She was suffering from `Breast Cancer` during her last days and wanted to come out of closet through her biography. She chose `Monique`, a struggling writer for `Vivane`(magazine) for writing her biography. A curious Monique wondered why Evelyn Hugo had chosen her out of all the writers. Evelyn asked Monique to justify her true character in the book. It was not in her interest to whitewash her actions. \n\n### Marriages\n- She married `Ernie Diaz` to get out of her depressing town where her father treated her like trash.\n- Fell in love with superstar `Don Adler`, became a victim of #domestic-violence, divorced.\n- Went to LA and married `Mick Riva` for a day to stop spreading any rumours about her and Celia.\n- Married `Rex North` as a publicity stunt to get TRP for upcoming movie.\n- Married her best-friend `Harry Cameron`(gay) to start a family of her own.\n- Fell in love with her director `Max Girard` divorced soon after she received a hint from Celia on getting back together.\n- Married `Robert Jamison`, Celia's brother to settle with Celia in Europe.\n- Married `Celia` in her bedroom. Celia suffered from a disease, died few years after.\n\n\n## Takeaways\n\n- `When you're given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen.

And yet you risked your life to protect me_\n\n- If a tactic has lead to failure, then persisting with it unquesttioningly in the wild hope of a different outcome, is nothing short of insanity.\n\n- Emperor Prithu had spoken of the ideal human archetype of the _aryaputra_, a gentleman, and the _aryaputri_, a lady, a prototypical human partnership of two strong individuals, who didn't compete for exact equality but were complimentary, completing each other.

This is necessary when App sends callback as a Prop to child.\n- Rule of Thumb: always wrap _the function in useCallback_ which is passed as a prop if the __component is memoized__.\n\n```js\n  const handleChange = useCallback((e) => {\n    setSearchKey(e.target.value);\n  },[])\n```\n\n### useMemo hook\nuseMemo will only recompute the memoized value when one of the dependencies has changed. This optimization helps to avoid expensive calculations on every render.\n\n\n## Code splitting\n\n```jsx\nimport OtherComponent from './OtherComponent';\nAfter:\nconst OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));\n```\n\n## Suspense\n\n```jsx\n  <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}></Suspense>\n\n```","n":0.074}}},{"i":48,"$":{"0":{"v":"Fundamentals","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n## React\n\nA JS library for building User interfaces.\n\n- uses Virtual DOM\n- unindirectional data flow\n- reusable UI components\n\n## Functional components over Class\n- use functional comp over class, after 16.8 hooks can be used as lifecycle events.\n- use class component when you want a react functionality that is not availabke for functions yet, eg: error boundries\n- Only class components can be error boundaries.

While both of them hold information that influences the output of render, they are different in their functionality with respect to component.

This means any variable is not strictly bind to a data type.\n\n## Execution context\n\nExecution context is simply the environment within which your code is ran.\nIt has 2 components\n\n- Memory Component(Variable environment): variable and funcs are stored in key: value pairs.\n- Code Component(Thread of execution): place where code is executed one line at a time.\n\n### Two stages of Execution context\n\n- **creation**(memory creation) and\n- **executing**(code execution) phase.\n\n### Two types of execution context\n\n- Global and Function\n\nAs the JavaScript engine starts to read your code, it creates something called the Global Execution Context.\n\n## Lexical environment\n\n- A lexical environment is basically the scope or environment the engine is currently\n  reading code in.\n- A new lexical environment is created when curly brackets {} are used,\n  even nested brackets {{...}} create a new lexical environment.\n- The execution context tells the engine which lexical environment it is currently working in and the lexical scope determines the available variables.\n- lexical env of a func: local memory of function + refrence to lexical parents's lexical env(closure) + lexical env of parent's parent until global scope.\n\n## Scope chain\n\nEach environment context that is created has a link outside of its lexical environment \ncalled the scope chain. The scope chain gives us access to variables in the parent \nenvironment.\n\n## Block\n- defined by `{}`. It groups together multiple js statements and use it where js syntax is expecting single statement\n- let/const are `block scoped`.\n- a new `{}` does not create a new scope for `var`, var is a `function` scope\n\n## let and const\n- are hoiseted, but are in `temporal dead zone`(the time between a let/const is hoisted and initialized with a value) for the time being.\n- accessing a variable in temporal dead zone throws reference error\n- cannot redeclare let and const within the same scope unlike `var`. let will throw syntax error and const will throw Type error, since const is of `constant` type.\n- `const` needs to be declare and initialization at the same time, unlike `let` which can be initialized later in the code.\n- unlinke `var` let/const are block scoped. Each `{}` creates a new scope for let/const\n\n## closure\nfunction along with its lexical scope bundled together forms a closure.\nUses: currying\n\n## Hoisting\n\n- Hoisting is the process of puting all variable and function declarations into memory\n  during the compile phase.\n- var are hoisted(allocated memory) and initialized with a value of `undefined`\n- function declarations are fully hoisted eg: function a() {}\n- function expression are hoisted as undefined. (eg: var a = function () {})\n- let and const are hoisted but are not initialized with any initial value. Using them before initialization throws reference error\n\n### Takeaways\n\nAvoid hoisting when possible. It can cause memory leaks and hard to catch\nbugs in your code. Use let and const as your go to variables.\n\n## Difference between arrow function and normal function\n\n- arrow funcs are not just a syntactic sugar to normal functions\n- They are a compact alternative to a regular function, but also without its own bindings to `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target` keywords.\n- Arrow func cannot be used as constructors and are not the best option for methods.\n\n```js\nvar obj = {\n // does not create a new scope\n i: 10,\n b: () => console.log(this.i, this),\n c: function() {\n console.log(this.i, this);\n }\n};\nobj.b(); // prints undefined, Window {...} (or the global object)\nobj.c(); // prints 10, Object {...}```\n```\n\n## Call, bind, apply\n\n### Call\n- invoke a function with passed references and arguments.\n- used function borrowing\n- 1st param of call is a reference, i.e what should call bind this to? rest are the arguments to the function\n\n### bind\nreturns you a copy of method which can be called later.\n- function borrowing\n- When a function is used as a callback, `this` is lost. The bind() method solves this problem.\neg: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_bind.asp\n\npolyfill for bind:\n```js\nconst uname2 = {\n\tfname: \"Jo\",\n\tlname: \"Joshi\",\n}\nfunction fullName(city,state) {\n\tconsole.log(this.fname + \" \" + this.lname + \" \" + city + \" \" + state)\n}\nFunction.prototype.myBind2 = function(...args) {\n\tconst fun = this;\n\tconst param = args.slice(1)\n\treturn function(...arg) {\n\t\tfun.apply(args[0], [...param,...arg])\n\t}\n}\n\nconst test = fullName.myBind2(uname2,\"hld\")\ntest(\"UK\");\n```\n\n## Currying\n\n- by bind method\n```js\nlet multiply = function(x,y) {\n\tconsole.log(x*y)\n}\n\nconst multiplyBy2 = multiply.bind(this, 2);\nmultiplyBy2(9)\n```\n\n- by closures\n```js\n function multiply(x) {\n\treturn function(y) {\n\t\treturn x*y\n\t}\n }\n const multiplyBy2 = multiply(2);\n console.log(multiplyBy2(4))\n```\n\n### imp interview ques\nhttps://javascriptinterviewquestions.com/2020/04/add123-in-javascript-currying-interview.html\n\n## Debounce\n\n- limiting the rate of execution of a particular function\n\n## this\n\nFree function invocations in javascript have `this` bound to the global scope.\n\n\n## Event Propagation\nhappens in 3 phases\n- Capturing phase: event goes down from root element to the target element\n- target phase: event reaches the target elem\n- bubbling phase: When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.\nTo stop bubbling: event.stopPropagation()\n```html\n<body onclick=\"alert(`the bubbling doesn't reach here`)\">\n  <button onclick=\"event.stopPropagation()\">Click me</button>\n</body>\n```\n\n## Async vs defer\n\n### Defer\nThe defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for the script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, build DOM. The script loads “in the background”, which makes it non-blocking and then runs when the DOM is fully built.\n\nHere’s the same example as above, but with defer:\n\n```html\n<p>...content before script...</p>\n\n<script defer src=\"https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1\"></script>\n\n<!-- visible immediately -->\n<p>...content after script...</p>\n```\n\n- DOMContentLoadedEvent\nBoth solves two problems\nScripts can’t see DOM elements below them, so they can’t add handlers etc.\nIf there’s a bulky script at the top of the page, it “blocks the page”. Users can’t see the page content till it downloads and runs:\n\n\n## Folder structure\n\n- package.json: app metadata and configuration\n- manifest.json: app metadata that makes application progressive web app.\n  - provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a\n    user's mobile device or desktop.
